# BMP-renderer-
This is my computer architecture homework, where I've written a program in assembly x86 language. The program is designed to render images with a resolution of 320x200 pixels and a color depth of 8 bits per pixel. The first argument entered inline should specify the image's name along with its extension, for example, "name.bmp". I used TASM for compiling this program.
